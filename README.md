## Assignment 1: Registration Form

### Overview

## Assignment 2: Hangman

### Overview
Your task is to create a Hangman game using Angular. The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where one player chooses a word, and the other player must guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hanging man is drawn. The game is won if the guesser can guess the word before the hanging man is fully drawn.

### Requirements
Your application should have the following features:
- The game should start with a randomly chosen word from a predefined list of words.
- The game should display the number of incorrect guesses made and the number of remaining guesses.
- The game should display the current state of the word being guessed, with blank spaces for each letter that has not yet been guessed and the corresponding letters for each correctly guessed letter.
- The game should allow the player to make a guess by typing a letter.
- The game should display a message when the game is won or lost.
- The game should allow the player to start a new game at any time.

### Tips
- Use components to display the game and handle user input.
- Use services to manage the state of the game.
- Use directives to display the hanging man (or any other display system that you want to use for displaying the mistakes).
- Use pipes to format the game state for display.
