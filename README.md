## Assignment 1: Registration Form

### Overview
In this assignment, you will create a registration form using Angular. The form should include fields for name, email, phone number, password, confirm password, and a save button. Each field should be mandatory and include specific validation rules.

### Form Details

## Assignment 2: Hangman

### Overview
Your task is to create a Hangman game using Angular. The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where one player chooses a word, and the other player must guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hanging man is drawn. The game is won if the guesser can guess the word before the hanging man is fully drawn.

### Requirements
Your application should have the following features:
- The game should start with a randomly chosen word from a predefined list of words.
- The game should display the number of incorrect guesses made and the number of remaining guesses.
- The game should display the current state of the word being guessed, with blank spaces for each letter that has not yet been guessed and the corresponding letters for each correctly guessed letter.
- The game should allow the player to make a guess by typing a letter.
- The game should display a message when the game is won or lost.
- The game should allow the player to start a new game at any time.

### Tips
- Use components to display the game and handle user input.
- Use services to manage the state of the game.
- Use directives to display the hanging man (or any other display system that you want to use for displaying the mistakes).
- Use pipes to format the game state for display.

## Assignment 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Overview and Requirements
You must replicate a functional tic-tac-toe game using Angular:
- The game board should consist of a 3x3 grid of squares, with each square being clickable and starting out empty.
- The game should start with player X's turn.
- When a player clicks on a square, it should become marked with that player's symbol (either X or O, depending on whose turn it is).
- After a player makes a move, it should become the other player's turn.
- If a player gets three symbols in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), all 3 winning symbols will be highlighted, and the game should end with that player declared the winner.
- If all squares are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, the game should end in a tie.
- After the game ends, the players should be given the option to start a new game.
